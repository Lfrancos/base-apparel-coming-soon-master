## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This time I wanted to take the challenge a little bit further from the things that I've been doing with javascript. Normally what I've been doing is to create all the elements in the HTML file and then turn on or of the things depending on the error.
But here I decided to create all the elements that where only needed by errors with javascript. I still fell that I need to keep working on it, the way that it is deleting the things I'm not sure if it is the optimal way but I feel I'll get to understand what is the best way.

### Continued development

Here I tried to use BEM but to tell the truth I don't think I was able to use it as good as I should. I need to keep pushing myself to understand the best practices to make my work easier.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://javascriptsimplified.com/) - This helped me to use functions in javascript, I was not using the functionality of the functions and was getting a little frustrated by that. I think this is getting me a little bit closer to understand how to create more interesting code.
